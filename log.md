# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began process of creating new form to add mental models to the mental model dictionary with high re-use of code, increasing maintainability.

**Thoughts:** I really think the Mental Model flow isn't bad, but the code standards will need to be updated as I've learned more with React, so in the near future, that will be one of the tasks I have :).

### Day 2: December 31th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Updated a page's props to destructuring to pass them down to correct pages. Added the ability to upload a new image using FileInput on ReactMD by creating a new firebase storage controller! Good day!

**Thoughts:** I added a bit of tech debt to our backlog to update controller apis or ui to use suspense for success/error/loading progress.
